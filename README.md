# SQL-Pizza-order-Analysis
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries designed for analyzing a pizza ordering system. The queries provide insights into various aspects of the order data, including the total number of orders placed, the total revenue generated from pizza sales, and the highest-priced pizza. Additionally, the queries identify the most common pizza sizes ordered and list the top five most ordered pizza types along with their quantities. They also aggregate the total quantity of each pizza category ordered and analyze the distribution of orders by hour of the day. Further, the queries calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day, determine the top three most ordered pizza types based on revenue, and compute the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue. Finally, they analyze cumulative revenue over time and rank the most ordered pizza types within each category. This comprehensive set of queries serves as a valuable tool for understanding customer preferences and optimizing sales strategies.
